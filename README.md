Wizard Bridge EVM | Fact Protocol Interface (Proof of Signed)

This is what we doing. It is a unique ERC-20 bridge that supports all EVM Chains. It works similarly to WrappedToken, but with the special ability it can receive and cross networks correctly. I call this project "Wizard Bridge EVM | Fact Protocol Interface : (Proof of Message)"

Goal: We intend to build a bridge (ERC-20) that supports EVM on any 800+ network, is fast, secure, low on gas. The fees are low (I like web3 and dapps that are useful and usable) and there are constantly evolving protocols and other things that developers and people can build on.

Plan: Beyond expectations Working with Oracle(Chainlink) and AMM(Uniswap) and developing SDK & Framework is a guess. If it can be done, it will be a complete Bridge.

Projects have open source and that welcome all developers to build and work in decentralized teams are important and have a profoundly positive impact on communities and the digital world.
